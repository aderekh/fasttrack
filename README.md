Task:

In this exercise, we'd like you to design a database for an iGaming company. The company allows users to log in with a unique username and password, and they can deposit and withdraw money to play games. Things to consider while designing the tables:

Fields datatypes
Primary keys
Foreign keys

Queries:
List all users having 3 deposits or more;
List all users having only 1 withdrawal;
List 3 users that have made the highest deposits;
List all deposits for users. Display UserId, UserName, DepositDate, DepositAmount;
Calculate balances of all users.


I created 3 files to deploy the database to Docker. dockerfile, docker-compose.yml and creadb.sql. I populated the database manually so that I can run queries and retrieve information.
SQL queries are in answers.db file and I have provided the results as screenshots.
